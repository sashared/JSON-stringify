# JSON.stringify-try
My realization of JSON.stringify (js)

This is my realization of JSON.stringify. As far as I have tested, it works. The only difference is that the line color is black, but not red. This program writes stringified version of given object/array into variable named "a". The code resets "a", so the information stored in it will be lost. To activate program, copy the text in the adjacent file named "algoritmical" then type "fn(*varible that needs to be stringified). After getting the rezult you may type "a" to get the line colored the same way as after using JSON.stringify on the same variable.

After getting a rezult:
JSON.stringify(a) will return the line with a lot of \ throughout it. 
fn(a) will will return the line with "" on both ends of it.

Tested in Google Chrome 53.0.2785.116.
