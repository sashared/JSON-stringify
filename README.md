# JSON.stringify-try
My realization of JSON.stringify (js)

This is my realization of JSON.stringify. As far as I have tested, it works. The only difference is that the line color is black, but not red. This program writes stringified version of given object/array into variable named "a". The code resets "a", so the information stored in it will be lost. To activate program, copy the text in the adjacent file named "algoritmical" then type "fn(*varible that needs to be stringified). After that you may type "a" to get the line colored the same way as after JSON.stringify the same variable.
If trying to JSON.stringify(a) the rezult you may get a lot of \ throughout the line. 
If trying to fn(a) the rezult you will get extra "" on both sides of the line.
Tested in Google Chrome 53.0.2785.116.
